    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern the access or use by you, an individual, of applications, websites, content, products, and services (the "Services") made available by Velocito, 
        a private limited liability company established in India. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES. Your access and use of the Services constitute your agreement to be bound by these Terms,
        establishing a contractual relationship between you and Velocito. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. 
        Velocito may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason. Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services,
         such as policies for a particular event, activity, or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable Services.
         Supplemental terms are in addition to and shall be deemed a part of the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services. 
         Velocito may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon Velocito’s posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service. 
         Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended. Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the 
        Services are as provided in Velocito’s Privacy Policy located at https://www.velocito.com/privacy/notice. Velocito may provide to a claims processor or an insurer any necessary information (including your contact information)
         if there is a complaint, dispute, or conflict, which may include an accident, involving you and a Third Party Provider (including a transportation network company driver), 
        and such information or data is necessary to resolve the complaint, dispute, or conflict.</p>
    
    <h2>2. The Services</h2>

         of such services, including independent third-party transportation providers and independent third-party logistics providers under agreement with Velocito or certain of Velocito’s affiliates ("Third Party Providers").
          Unless otherwise agreed by Velocito in a separate written agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, non-commercial use. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
         THAT VELOCITO DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION OR LOGISTICS SERVICES OR FUNCTION AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER AND THAT ALL SUCH TRANSPORTATION OR LOGISTICS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYED BY VELOCITO OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Use Of The Services</h2>

You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up- to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or Velocito’s termination of these Terms with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Velocito in writing, you may only possess one Account.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 User Requirements And Conduct</h3>
    <p>The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18.

    <p>Velocito may, in Velocito’s sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit, or other features or benefits related to the Services and/or a Third Party Provider’s services, subject to any additional terms that Velocito establishes on a per promotional code basis (“Promo Codes”). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Velocito; (iii) may be disabled by Velocito at any time for any reason without liability to Velocito; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Velocito establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use.

    <h3>3.5 User Provided Content</h3>
    <p>Velocito may, in Velocito’s sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish, or otherwise make available to Velocito through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions (“User Content”). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to Velocito, you grant Velocito a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Velocito’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity. You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content, or you have all rights, licenses, consents, and releases necessary to grant Velocito the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing, or otherwise making available of such User Content nor Velocito’s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation. You agree not to provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Velocito in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. Velocito may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at Velocito’s sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.</p>

    <h3>3.6 Network Access And Devices</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network’s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device, and you shall be responsible for such rates and fees. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. Velocito does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.</p>

    <h2>4. Payment</h2>
    <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from Velocito and / or a Third Party Provider (“Charges ”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Services, Velocito will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges received on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of such Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. All Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Velocito reserves the right to charge you amounts for, among others, applicable tolls, fees, and charges incurred for the provision of services by the Third Party Providers, charges for the Services, pickup facility provided at various places, each along with applicable taxes (including but not limited to GST). Please note that Velocito shall determine the city in which your trip commences as your address on record of Velocito, wherever available. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Velocito. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. Velocito will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Velocito using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Velocito will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Velocito may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. As between you and Velocito, Velocito reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise the Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Velocito’s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Velocito will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Velocito may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers, subscriptions, and discounts that may result in discounted amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers, subscriptions, and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to compensate the Third Party Provider and Velocito for the services or goods provided. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, Velocito does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by Velocito (on Velocito’s website, in the Application, or in Velocito’s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Velocito provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Repair or Cleaning Fees</h3>
    <p>You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, Third Party Provider vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal “wear and tear” damages and necessary cleaning (“Repair or Cleaning”). In the event that a Third Party Provider reports the need for Repair or Cleaning, and such Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Velocito in Velocito’s reasonable discretion, Velocito reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning on behalf of the Third Party Provider using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts will be transferred by Velocito to the applicable Third Party Provider and are non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>VELOCITO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, PERSONAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RELATED TO, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM ANY USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF VELOCITO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. VELOCITO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY, OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF: (i) YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; OR (ii) ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER, EVEN IF VELOCITO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. VELOCITO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM CAUSES BEYOND VELOCITO’S REASONABLE CONTROL. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIRD PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES REQUESTED THROUGH SOME REQUEST BRANDS MAY OFFER RIDESHARING OR PEER-TO-PEER TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND MAY NOT BE PROFESSIONALLY LICENSED OR PERMITTED. IN NO EVENT SHALL VELOCITO’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED FIVE HUNDRED EUROS (€500). VELOCITO’S SERVICES MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR LOGISTICS SERVICES WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT VELOCITO HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO YOU RELATED TO ANY TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER IN THIS SECTION 5 DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

    <h2>7. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Velocito and its officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with:</p>

Any dispute, conflict, claim, or controversy arising out of or broadly in connection with or relating to the Services or these Terms, including those relating to its validity, its construction, or its enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted to mediation proceedings in terms of Indian law. If such Dispute has not been settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation has been submitted under Indian laws, such Dispute can be referred to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the Act. The place of both mediation and arbitration shall be India. The language of the mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not speak English, in which case the mediation and/or arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native language. The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, any correspondence from the mediator, and correspondence, orders, and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the other party unless: (i) the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings, and (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound by the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein. </p>

    <h2>Other Provisions</h2>
    <h3>Claims Of Copyright Infrigement</h3>
    <p>Claims of copyright infringement should be sent to Velocito’s designated agent. Please visit Velocito’s web page at https://www.velocito.com/legal for the designated address and additional information. NOTICE. Velocito may give notice by means of a general notice on the Services, electronic mail to your email address in your Account, or by written communication sent to your address as set forth in your Account. You may give notice to Velocito by written communication to Velocito's address as mentioned above GENERAL.

No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, Velocito, or any Third Party Provider as a result of the contract between you and Velocito or use of the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of these Terms but the legality, validity, and enforceability of the other provisions in these Terms shall not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid, and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents and purpose of these Terms.

    <h3>Veloctio Guidelines For Law Enforcement Authorities</h3>
    <p>The following guidelines are intended to inform law enforcement about the legal process for seeking records from Velocito. These are merely guidelines, and this information may change at any time. For private party requests, including requests from civil litigants and criminal defendants, we recommend browsing Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests.</p>

    <h3>What is Velocito And What Records Do We Have</h3>
    <p>Velocito is a technology company that has developed an app that connects users (riders) with driver partners who provide transportation to the user. Velocito is not a transportation carrier and does not employ any drivers. Users can use the Velocito App to request transportation via their smartphone, the web, or via SMS. Velocito users can choose from a variety of drivers available in their location. At the end of the ride, both the driver partner and user receive a copy of the fare receipt. More information about our services is available here. We store and maintain information as described in our Privacy Statements and our Terms of Use.</p>

    <h3>What Type Of Legal Process Does Uber Require Before Producing User Or Partner information?</h3>
    <p>For U.S. Law Enforcement We require valid and sufficient legal process before we can disclose business records regarding partners, users, or trips. In most instances, we won’t be able to provide any information without a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We accept law enforcement requests via email to LERT@velocito.com or via personal service through our corporate agent, National Registered Agents, Inc., 818 W. Seventh Street, Suite 930, Los Angeles, California 90017. Our acceptance of legal process does not waive any legal objections Velocito may have and may raise in response to the request.</p>

    <h3>What Form Of Requests Does Velocito Require, And How Are Requests Processed?</h3>
    <p>To respond to a request, we will need to receive the applicable process described above, as well as a valid return email address from an official government domain. We review each request for facial and substantive validity, and will reject requests that are not facially and substantively valid. Among other things, we require requests to be narrowly tailored to a legitimate law enforcement need and will reject overly broad, vague, or unduly burdensome requests. In order to make sure your Law Enforcement Request is valid and does not seek more information than necessary, we ask for the following: A sufficiently narrow/defined time period; A specific event or action that the subject took; A specific reference (i.e., you must uniquely identify a user or driver partner) We disclose data to law enforcement when we determine that we are required to do so by law. In those instances, we will search for and disclose data that we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve.</p>

    <h3>How Does Velocito Handle Emergency Requests</h3>
    <p>We have a process for evaluating requests on an emergency basis where there is an emergency that involves protecting a user, driver partner, or third party or stopping illegal activity that poses an immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm. Requestors must submit an Emergency Request Form (which can be requested through LERT@velocito.com) that describes in detail the nature of the emergency, and we review these requests on a case-by-case basis. Law enforcement can submit an emergency request by emailing LERT@velocito.com. Please note that we will only review and respond to emergency requests from law enforcement, and will not respond to emergency requests sent to this address by non-law enforcement officials. Non-law enforcement officials aware of an emergency situation should immediately and directly contact local law enforcement officials.</p>

    <h3>Does Velocito Notify individuals Of A Law Enforcement Request For Information Relating To Them?</h3>
    <p>Yes, we may notify subjects before producing their information to law enforcement, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so, or in exceptional circumstances such as emergencies. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.</p>

    <h3>Does Velocito Provide A Certificate Of Authentication Or Expert Testimony?</h3>
    <p>We may provide a certification from our records custodian but are not generally able to provide in-person or expert witness testimony. Law enforcement officials with questions about these guidelines should email LERT@velocito.com. Please note that we will not respond to non-law enforcement inquiries received at this email address. For non-law enforcement inquiries, please see Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests.</p>
